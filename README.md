# Systems-Lab03

For this assignment, do not create helper functions, put everything inside main (it won-t be too long). We will talk about passing arrays and pointers are function arguments next week.

1. Create an array large enough to store 10 ints.
2. Set the first value in the array to 0.
3. Populate the rest of the array with random values in the range -128 to 127.(you can make a function to generate )
4. Print out the values in this array in the format "[1, -3, 4, 7....,9]" that is: ", " between values with [] around the whole set.
5. Create a second array of the same size.
6. Create pointer variables that will point to each array.
7. USING ONLY POINTER VARIABLES (that is, do not use the array variables) do the following:
   * Populate the second array with the values in the first but in reverse order
   * Print out the values in the second array using pointer notation *
   * Do this last step again using array notation (try the array variable and the pointer variable with the [] ).
